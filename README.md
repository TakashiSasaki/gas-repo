# Google Apps Script Project Management

This repository is used to download all projects from Google Apps Script and manage them using Git.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to provide a centralized location for:

*   **Backing up** your Google Apps Script projects.
*   **Version controlling** your scripts, allowing you to track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate more effectively.
*   **Managing** multiple Google Apps Script projects within a single Git repository structure.

## How it Works (General Idea)

Typically, this setup involves using a tool like `clasp` (the command-line tool for Google Apps Script) or custom scripts to:

1.  **List** all your Google Apps Script projects.
2.  **Clone** or **pull** each project into a local directory structure within this repository.
3.  **Commit** changes to Git to keep a history of your script development.

This allows you to leverage the power of Git for your Google Apps Script development workflow.

## Scheduled Workflows

This repository utilizes GitHub Actions workflows to automate certain tasks. These workflows operate on the `gas-pull` branch.

### Sync from GAS

*   **Schedule:** Runs daily (at 20 minutes past every hour).
*   **Purpose:** Automatically pulls the latest code from all registered Google Apps Script projects.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Checks out the `gas-pull` branch.
    2.  Uses `clasp` to pull updates for each linked Google Apps Script project into its corresponding directory.
    3.  If any changes are detected, commits them to the `gas-pull` branch with the message "chore: daily sync GAS â†’ gas-pull".

### Update Apps Script Projects List

*   **Schedule:** Runs hourly (at the start of every hour).
*   **Purpose:** Keeps an updated list of all Google Apps Script projects associated with the account.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Checks out the `gas-pull` branch.
    2.  Uses `clasp list` to fetch the current list of projects.
    3.  Saves this list to the `clasp-list.txt` file.
    4.  If the `clasp-list.txt` file has changed since the last run, commits the updated file to the `gas-pull` branch with the message "Update Apps Script projects list". This workflow uses a force push.

These workflows help ensure that the repository remains a current backup and version-controlled representation of your Google Apps Script projects.
